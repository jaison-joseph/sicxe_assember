1. when we have an instruction that uses immediate/indirect addressing, we
    cannot use indexed based addressing. However, if we do come across such a
    case, we simply ignore it. Should raise an error for that.


2. should i allow for indexed based addressing on an LDX instruction?

3. a check to see if we have encountered multiple instructions that are only
  supposed to happen once?

4. need to validate the extdef and extref of each of the csect's after pass 1
